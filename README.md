TGAC-2014-genome-annotation
===========================

Course materials for the genome annotation part of the [TGAC SeqAhead course 2014](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/seqahead-challenges-for-plant-researchers/). Although these materials were written for the course, they should be useful to anyone wanting to learn about plant genome annotation.

By: Richard Smith-Unna ([Blahah](Https://github.com/Blahah)) <rds45@cam.ac.uk>.

The course covers both structural and functional annotation of plant genomes, and is aimed at those familiar with bioinformatics in general, able to run commands in the terminal, but not yet up to speed with genome annotation.

### Outcomes

By the end of the course you should:

- understand what structural and functional annotation are
- be aware of the main theoretical approaches to these tasks
- know which software to use
- understand what outputs to generate
- be able to performa first-draft annotation of newly assembled genome
